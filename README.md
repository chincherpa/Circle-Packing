# Circle Packing / [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkJHDIwPQ9E)

My attempt at making brute force circle packing.Each circle avoids collision by validating that the distance between circle centers is greater than the sum of their radii. Utilizing a grid and only comparing against neighboring cells resulted in significant performance increases.
